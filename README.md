MiniMIPSimulator
================

Not really a MIPS simulator, but a basic pipeline simulator. There are a lot of bad programming practices here and I should probably go through and improve some coding style, but this was an early attempt. More importantly it shows some basic ideas about synchronizing buffers to allow for proper pipeline simulation.
